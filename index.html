<h2>Description</h2>

<p>YAML Command is a command line tool for working with YAML.</p>

<p>Currently it is very much a work in progress, so please do not be surprised if you
run into some limitations. In paricular, the command won't be as useful as it should
be until a  solid YPath library is available.</p>

<h2>Commands</h2>

<p>Commands are invoked simply enough:</p>

<pre><code>$ yaml &lt;command&gt; [options...] [arguments...]
</code></pre>

<h3>get</h3>

<p>The <code>get</code> command simply extracts a portion of a YAML file and outputs
it to stdout.</p>

<h3>set</h3>

<p>The <code>set</code> commnd is the opposite of <code>get</code> in that it lets you change
a portion of a YAML file. By defult the changes YAML document will go
to stdout, using the <code>--save</code> option rewrites the file with the change.</p>

<h3>sort</h3>

<p>The sort command can be used to sort portions of a YAML document.</p>

<h3>slurp</h3>

<p>Slurp takes a directory and converts it's contents into a YAML file.</p>

<h3>splat</h3>

<p>Splat take a YAML file and converts it into a file directory structure.
It is essentially the opposite of slurp.</p>

<h3>edit</h3>

<p>Edit will open a YAML file for editing in the default editor (as defined by
$EDITOR), and allow you to edit it.</p>

<p>If instead you edit a directory, the the directory will be automatically
slurped into a temporary file. After editing the temporary file will be
splatted back out to update the directory and it's files.</p>

<h3>view</h3>

<p>Outputs a colized rendering of the YAML file.</p>

<h2>Requirements</h2>

<p>YAML Command uses the <a href="http://rubyworks.github.com/executable">Executable</a> library for
command line parsing and the <a href="http://rubyworks.github.com/ansi">ANSI</a>
library for handling console colorization.</p>
